Welcome to the 'Weather Project'! This is an application I have designed to showcase some of the skills I have developed in key areas like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows a user to search and retrieve a specified location's weather data, as well as interact with how that information is displayed on screen. 
This project is a continued effort to learn and improve, so any and all feedback you may have would be greatly appreciated!
