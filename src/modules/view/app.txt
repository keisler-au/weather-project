The "app.js" module contains the main "App" component that combines the other 'unit' components. "FilterFieldsets" returns an array of <div> nodes and React components, isolating logic that would otherwise by in "App" and thus making it more readable. "ErrorBoundary" is a class that renders a custom error message when an error is caught in one of it's child components. 

"App" is currently in the process of being integration tested using the 'Cypress' framework. This testing suite would assess whether user interactions and the resulting communication between components are behaving as expected.
