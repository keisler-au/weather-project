The "parsing-data" module has three functions; "convertTempData", "getDateString", and "parseData". "convertTempData" takes in a "data" object, and converts the "Temperature" attribute value from celsius to fahrenheit or vice versa if the 'fahrenheit' radio button is checked. 
"getDateString" takes in a unix timestamp and converts it to 24hr time string representation, or a day and date string representation depending on whether the "time" parameter is true or false.
"parseData" takes in a "data" object, the response from a request to "OpenWeather API". The object gets unpacked for the relevant values inside a 'try block', and are defined to a new formatted object template "parsedData". Unix timestamps are converted to strings ("getDateString"), measurements are rounded, and descriptions are capitalised. The unpacked temperature data is in degrees celsius, so if the 'fahrenheit' radio button is checked, "convertTempData" is used to convert that temperature data to fahrenheit. The parsed data set is then returned. A TypeError occuring due to unpacking the object will be caught by the 'try block', with a specific message is logged to the console. This is likely to occur when the "data" object passed into "parseData" is empty or if does not follow the standardised format. Otherwise all other errors will be logged to the console with a generic error message. If an error is caught, the same formatted object template is returned but as an empty data set, with no assigned values.

The "parsing-data" test file contains unit tests for "getDateString" and "convertTempData", where specifying parameters are expected to return converted values (unix timestamp to string, and celsius to/from fahrenheit, respectively). "parseData" is tested with a standardised "data" object object as a parameter, with the expected returned value being a parsed data set, with formatted key:value pairs. The 'try block' is expected to catch and log a specific message for TypeErrors, and is tested by mocking the console.log method and passing an empty object into "parseData" to simulate a non-standardised data set. An empty formatted template is expected to be returned.
