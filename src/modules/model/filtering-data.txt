"filtering-data" function creates a new "filteredData" object using the 'categories' in "filteredCategories" that are set to 'true', and their corresponding data points in "data". As a user clicks on an input checkbox (filter), this updates the "filteredCategories" object, and the "filteredData" object respectively. A 'for loop' iterates through both 'current' and 'daily' tables of "filteredCategories", with another 'for loop' iterating through each category for that table. If the category is set to 'true', "addCategoryMetric()" adds the unit metrics to the category header (string), which then gets assigned to "filteredData" as a key, with it's value being its corresponding data point in "data". Each category in the 'daily' table may hold several data points for each day that has been selected to display by the user, the data points to include for each category is represented and implemented by the numbers in the "daysIncluded" array.

The output of "filterData()" is expected to be an object that reflects the information provided by the parameters of "filteredCategories" and "daysIncluded". Categories in "filteredCategories" that are set to 'false' are not expected to show up in the returned object, and the number of days specified in "daysIncluded" is expcted to be represented by the number of data points in the array of each 'daily' table category. Each data point included in the return object is retrieved from the "data" variable. Each category key added to the returned object is expected to be ammended to include additional unit metric information as implemented through "addCategoryMetric()". "addCategoryMetric" has it's own unit test as well as being tested through the "filterData" unit tests for to cover all pathways and provide more specificity in test results.
